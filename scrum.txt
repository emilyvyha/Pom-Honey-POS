Sprint 1 - Meeting 1:
    Agenda
        - Discussing how much front end work has been completed
        - Discussing how many tasks each member has completed
        - Discussing any challenges each member had so far and how to overcome them
    Accomplishments
        - Completed GUI for varying end users
        - Set up database connection for communication with server
    Plans
        - Finishing up the rest of the GUIs for all end users  
        - Implement all HTTP request
    Minutes
        Our very first meeting consisted of discussing how we were going to delegate the tasks.
        This was done after determining the roles each member had, which was split into front-end, 
        back-end, and project manager. Alex Keener and Reagan Reitmeyer had the back-end roles, 
        David Asatryan and Sry Hak had the front-end roles, and Emily Ha had the project manager role. 
        We all brainstormed how to split the tasks into smaller chunks and laid out an initial product backlog, 
        including what would be done by the first sprint as a minimal viable product. Our team decided to use React,
        HTML, CSS and Javascript for this project as it would work the best for our purposes.

Sprint 1 - Meeting 2:
    Agenda
        - Discussing what everyone has completed since the last scrum meeting
        - Discussing any issues with current work
    Plans
        - Finish the HTTP requests so that we can finish up the front end displays
        - Implementing more functionality for backend processes
    Minutes
        We discussed our current tasks on hand and any issues related to the process. We also discussed any tasks 
        completed since the first meeting about the project and the difficulties. One of the difficulties was just 
        the process of learning React and the syntax involved. There were more discussions on switching the assignment
        of tasks so that the project manager can help more when needed. As a result, more tasks will be assigned to the
        project manager from the sprint backlog.


Sprint 1 - Meeting 3:
    Agenda
        - Discussing any tasks that anyone is having trouble with
        - Discussing the tasks that have been completed
        - Demoing to the team functionality of the newly completed tasks
    Plans
        - Finish debugging backend functions
        - Implement all HTTP requests to display data on frontend
    Minutes
        We discussed any issues with our assigned tasks and finalized what needed to be done as a minimal viable product 
        for the first sprint. We ended up determining that some tasks previously assigned to the first sprint were not 
        necessary due to the time constraint we are on for the upcoming deadline. As a result, those tasks are assigned to 
        the second sprint. One issue discussed was Alex’s task where the postman server request would send back data before 
        the function completed and update the variables that would be returned to frontend. We brainstormed possible solutions 
        such as waiting on threads but none have worked so far.

Sprint 2 - Meeting 1: 11/13/22
    Agenda
        - Figuring out the tasks for sprint 2
        - Assigning tasks to members depending on time constraint
    Plans
        - Adding ability to cancel an order
        - Collecting analytical information to display on pages for front end
        - Creating HTTP request for the manager's statistics and adding new menu item
        - Adding functionality for adding new menu item for inventory
        - Checking for low stock for inventory items
    Minutes
        From the previous meeting, we discussed any remaining tasks before the sprint ended and what we have created for the 
        minimal viable product. We also did a mock demo in preparation for the demo during the lab. We discussed pushing some 
        tasks from sprint 1 onto sprint 2 as well due to time constraints.

Sprint 2 - Meetng 2: 11/18/22
    Agenda
        - Any challenges so far for members with their current tasks
        - Any tasks that everyone has completed since the last meeting
    Accomplishments
        - Creating HTTP request for adding new menu items
        - Function for checking for low stock for inventory items
        - Collecting analytical information for itemized receipt
    Plans
        - Collecting analytical information for the rest of the displays for UI
        - Implementing the google APIs such as translation, maps, and OAuth
        - Creating HTTP request for the rest of the functions
    Minutes
        During the previous meeting, we discussed any tasks that were completed. After learning that everyone was working 
        on a big assignment from another course and did not have the time to work on this project, we had no completed tasks 
        at the moment. This is not a big deal as we completed the bulk of our entire project during sprint 1. We also discussed 
        any questions we had for the team overall such as specifics regarding a task.

        - Implement google translate
        - Implement google maps
        - Collect analytical information to display data for ordered items in a time period
    Minutes
        After discussing our progress and how long it will take certain remaining tasks to complete, we decided to move tasks 
        that aren’t necessary for this minimal viable product into sprint 3. As a result, we are less pressed for time for this 
        sprint. Sprint three contains mostly the finishing touches such as making sure the website is accessible and any tasks that 
        are proving to be too difficult at the moment. 

Sprint 3 - Meeting 1: 11/27/22
    Agenda
        - Any current issues for tasks for the sprint
        - What tasks everyone is working on at the moment and if help is needed
        - Discussing if we're on track with ideal burndown
    Accomplishments
        - None at the moment since thanksgiving break
    Plans
        - Revise color scheme to ensure that website is accessible
        - Revise website arrangement to ensure accessibility
        - Create HTTPS request to see items that haven't sold a lot of stock
        - Implement Google OAuth
        - Add animations to homepage
    Minutes
        This sprint really consists of the final touches to the project. As a result, the discussion from the last meeting from
        sprint 2 was about pushing any tasks to this sprint that aren't as pressing for the minimum viable product. However, some tasks
        that were a little too difficult in the time allowed were pushed to the third sprint as well. This includes the google OAuth
        API. With that in mind, being able to work on one big task and the finishing touches for a sprint makes it easier on the team.

Sprint 3 - Meeting 2: 11/30/22
    Agenda
        - Any current issues that anyone has and if members can help
        - What tasks that have been completed and what each member is currently Demoing
        - Making sure we're on track with ideal burndown
    Accomplishments
        - Implement check on negative inventory items
        - Add animations to homepage
        - Implemented google OAuth
        - Low stock shown on frontend

        - Host the website
        - Mobile integration
    Minutes
        Since the first week of the sprint was Thanksgiving break, we did not have the time to work on the project. As a result,
        last meeting was used to discuss any tasks we needed to add to the sprint that we did not account for when originally creating the 
        backlog for this project. We also delegated the tasks to each member. Progress on tasks that had to be pushed from sprint 2
        to this sprint were discussed as well. We ended the meeting feeling good about our progress.

Sprint 3 - Meeting 3: 12/02/22
    Agenda
        - Any current issues that anyone has and if members can help
        - What tasks that have been completed and what each member is currently Demoing
        - Making sure we're on track with ideal burndown
    Accomplishments
        - Low stock frontend
        - Create HTTPS request to see items that haven't sold a lot of stock
        - Revise color scheme to ensure that website is accessible
        - Revise website arrangement to ensure accessibility
    Plans
        - Host the website
        - Mobile integration
        - Track extra toppings used
    Minutes
        After our meeting with the professor, he mentioned a problem that we have to figure out a way to track the extra toppings that
        customers order. We discussed different ways to implement the task. We decided to create a page where it lists all the toppings
        and the employee can manually input the quantity at the end of the day. That will then be updated in the backend by subtracting 
        the amount for each extra topping. The most concerning task is hosting the website since there have been issues with getting it to 
        work successfully with backend although it works frontend wise.
